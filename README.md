# Paint with Sound

A web-based audio-visualizer that reacts to your microphone input. Play an instrument, speak, or make any sound, and watch the visual shaders respond in real time. The app splits the screen into four quadrants, each with a unique shader effect.

## Features

- **Real-time audio visualization** using the Web Audio API.
- **Four different shaders**:
  - Oscillating circles
  - Wave pattern
  - Flashing lights
  - Radial pulse
- **Customizable color and sensitivity** via a GUI.
- Works directly in the browser (no build tools required).

## Demo

Open `index.html` in a modern browser that supports WebGL and getUserMedia (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).

## Clone the repository:
